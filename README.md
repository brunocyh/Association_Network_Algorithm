# Association_Network_Algorithm
So there was one afternoon I was wondering, huh, how facebook's mutual friend recommendation system works? Then I started to reverse engineer and cameout with such algorithm.

When we look into the nature of this algorithm, we can actually apply it to "tag" systems to find out objects which are associated through network.

# Compexity:
Of coz this is just a prototype algorithm. It is impossible to run exhaustively all the time. One immediate solution for it is to run it only when u need it. So only find the "mutual friends" of urs only when u login, for example.
